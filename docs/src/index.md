# GaPSE.jl : a Galaxy Power Spectrum Estimator


This is the documentation of [GaPSE.jl](https://github.com/cosmofico97GaPSE) package, an implementation of a Galaxy Power Spectrum Estimator written in Julia.


## Documentation

The documentation was built using [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs).

```@example
using Dates # hide

## Brief description

Measurements of the clustering of galaxies in Fourier space, at low wavenumbers, offer a window into the early Universe via the possible presence of scale dependent bias generated by Primordial Non Gaussianities [[1]](#1) [[2]](#1).
On such large scales, a Newtonian treatment of density of density perturbations might not be sufficient to describe the measurements, and a fully relativistic calculation should be employed.

In this program, we compute, for a given input matter power spectum (obtained from CLASS, see https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public), all the GR effects two point auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, for an arbitrary multipole order.
This project, and the analytical expressions used for the TPCFs, are based on the article of Emanuele Castorina and Enea Di Dio [[3]](#1). 


The most confortable way to use this code is through the Jupyter Notebooks: some `.ipynb` is already provided in the main directory, and we encourage you to follow the `TUTORIAL.ipynb` file first. The basic structure of the program and the most important functions are there presented.
