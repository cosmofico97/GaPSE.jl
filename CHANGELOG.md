## development branch qls

- added `Dockerfile` for building the image `gapse-julia-1.9.1:0.8.0a`;

- IMPORTANT CHANGE: NOW YOU CAN GO FURTHER THAN `z=1.5`!

- IMPORTANT CHANGE: TWO TRACERS IMPLEMENTATION!
  Now you have two comsological biases sets `b1`, `s_b1`, `ùëì_evo1` and `b2`, `s_b2`, `ùëì_evo2` in the `CosmoParams` struct (you cannot specify anymore them as `b`, `s_b`, `ùëì_evo`);

- added all the previously missing docstrings in `GNCxLD` and `LD` TPCFs;

- added `ipynb/Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.ipynb`, `Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.jl` and `Generic_Window.jl` for the analysis of the PNG, even with a generic window function

- added `src/PowerSpectraGenWin.jl` and `src/WindowF_QMultipoles.jl`: now it's possible to compute the PS for a generic window!


## VERSION 0.7.0

- huge improvements on docstrings and API.

- renamed `src/PowerSpectrum.jl` to `src/PowerSpectra.jl`

- creation of the package `GaPSE.jl`; it will still take a while

## VERSION 0.6.0

- Made the docstrings for almost all the functions in the code; only the `LD`, `GNCxLD` and `LDxGNC` TPCFs are huge holes in this picture

- Improved the structure of the functions that manage the Integrated Window Function (`print_map_F` and `WindowF` in particular); some options have changed name
  
- Improved the structure of the functions that manage the Integrated Window Function (`print_map_IntegratedF` and `WindowFIntegrated` in particular); some options have changed name

- Improved the code for `PS_multipole` and associated functions; some options have changed name

## VERSION 0.5.0

- Implemented tests.

- Added the `PNG.jl` source code file for the analysis of the Primordial Non-Gaussianites

- Calibrated the integrals on `œá` for some of the GNC terms

- Now you can compute the integral on `Œº` (for `GNC`, `LD`,  `GNCxLD` and `LDxGNC` TPCFs) through three algorithms,and you can specify with one to use with the keyword argument `alg`:  `:quad`, `:lobatto`, and `:trap`.

## VERSION 0.4.0

- Added tests for all the previous features.

- Added `PPXiMatter.jl` for calculating the multipoles (with and without window function) of the matter TPCF.

- Added `XiMatter.jl` in order to compute a TPCF from a PS; the case of particular interests concerns the computation of the matter TPCF from the PS deriving from CLASS code.

- Added the file `WindowFIntegrated.jl`: now the computation of the TPCFs with the window function is correct.

- Added the functions `Œæ_GNCxLD_multipole`, `map_Œæ_GNCxLD_multipole`, `print_map_Œæ_GNCxLD_multipole`, their `sum_` extensions and their `LDxGNC` counterparts for the computations of the relativistic GNC effects.

- Implemented all the `GNCxLD` and `LDxGNC` TPCFs.
  
- Added the functions `Œæ_GNC_multipole`, `map_Œæ_GNC_multipole`, `print_map_Œæ_GNC_multipole` ant their `sum_` extensions for the computations of the relativistic GNC effects.

- Implemented all the `GNC` TPCFs.
  
- Changed the name of the following functions (because they refer to the LD perturbations):
  -  `Œæ_multipole` in `Œæ_LD_multipole`;
  -  `map_Œæ_multipole` in `map_Œæ_LD_multipole`;
  -  `print_map_Œæ_multipole` in `print_map_Œæ_LD_multipole`;
  -  `sum_Œæ_multipole` in `sum_Œæ_LD_multipole`;
  -  `map_sum_Œæ_multipole` in `map_sum_Œæ_LD_multipole`;
  -  `print_map_sum_Œæ_multipole` in `print_map_sum_Œæ_LD_multipole`;


## VERSION 0.3.0

- Added the functions for the evaluation of the Doppler auto-CF with the Plane-Parallel approximation and their tests

- Modified default range 10 .^ range(-1, 3, length= N_log) to  10 .^ range(0, 3, length= N_log) 

- Added tests for PS evaluation


## VERSION 0.2.0

- Modified the `CosmoParams` struct: now you should pass dictionaries for `InputPS` and `IPSTools` options

- Added the `ipynbs/TUTORIAL.ipynb` notebook, which is a small tour of how the code should be used

- Changed the keyword argument `s_1` into `s1` (in functions such as `map_Œæ_multipole`, `map_sum_Œæ_multipole`, ...)

- Removed the functions `integrand_on_mu`, `integral_on_mu`, `map_integral_on_mu` and `print_map_integral_on_mu`; added `integrand_Œæ_multipole`. This restructuration let the code more flexible.

- Optimized `F_map` and re-written its keyword argument structure

- Improved the documentation of the code, and the `README.md`



## VERSION 0.1.0

Created the basic structure of the program, with the structs `WindowF`, `InputPS`, `CosmoParams` and `Cosmology`.
It's possible to:
- read an arbitrary input matter power spectrum, produced by CLASS
- read an arbitrary input background data file, produced by CLASS
- write and read a map of the window F function
- calculate all the General Relativistic (GR) effects Two-Point Correlation Functions (TPCFs) multipole functions (both auto-correlation and cross-correlation) arising from the perturbed luminosity distance [[1]](#1) for an arbitrary multipole order 
- calculate the sum of all these TPCFs

Some notebook are already provided, inside the directory `ipynb`, such as:
- `ALL_CF_L.ipynb`
- `ALL_Multipoles.ipynb`
- `PS_Multipoles.ipynb`
- `SUM_CF.ipynb`
